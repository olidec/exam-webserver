    <h2 id="answers">Responses to the Exercises</h2>
    <ol id="answers-list">
        <li><strong>Exercise 1:</strong> Forked the fork and then forked some more.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise 2:</strong> That went rather well.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise 3:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The CSS-class of first column of the table is "scrape-this".</li>
                <li>The ouput of the scrape function is "Exam Webserver"</li>
            </ul>
            The rest I failed at, but the selector for both columns is 'td', so I put that in.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Exercise 4:</strong> Did the the link to the page, but it leads to nothing since I didn't know how to do the rest. There is an app route, but it doesn't work. </li>
        <li>I thought I could do it, apparently I can't. Cool.</li>
    </ol>
