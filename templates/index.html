    <h2>Welcome to our website.</h2><br>
    
    <h3>Why did we pick the game Snake?</h3>
    <p>Our first thought, when getting assigned this task was, 
    what is a game that everyone seems to enjoy and likes to play when bored? Well, throughout this whole school
    year our class has bonded over many things. One of them including computer games. When a class got cancelled,
    or when we were sitting in classrooms during winter, or even during the 5 minute breaks; a game that was
    most played throughout this whole year was Snake. So as a group we decided to recreate Snake and add our own
    touch to it. 
    Even though we struggled at the beginning and had never previously attempted something like this before, it 
    was quite an enlightening experience. We learned a lot of new ways to make things work, with the help of
    watching a lot of videos.</p><br>

    <h3>About the Game</h3>
    <p><strong>Rules of the game:</p></strong>
        <ul>1.	The game screen has a fixed width and height.</ul>
        <ul>2.	The game starts with the snake and food fixed at certain positions.</ul>
        <ul>3.	The snake changes direction as the user presses specific keys: Up, Left, Down, Right.</ul>
        <ul>4.	Once in motion (after the user presses a key), the snake keeps on moving in the said direction till the user presses another key.</ul>
        <ul>5.	The score (points) starts at zero and increases as the snake eats food.</ul>
    <p>The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves
       forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In the game,
       the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets
       longer as it moves. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen 
       border or itself.</p>

       <h3>Origin & History</h3>
       <p>The Snake design dates back to the arcade game "Blockade", developed 
          and published by Gremlin in 1976. The first known home computer 
          version, titled "Worm", was programmed in 1978 by Peter Trefonas. 
          The single-player Snake Byte was published in 1982; a snake eats 
          apples to complete a level, growing longer in the process. In 
          Snake (1982), by Dave Bresnen, the snake is controlled using 
          the left and right arrow keys relative to the direction it is 
          heading in. The snake increases in speed as it gets longer, 
          and there's only one life. </p>
